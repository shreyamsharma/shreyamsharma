# Hello! Welcome to my GitHub page! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
Every great product revolves around its customer. Whether its something that propels mankind forward or something that resolves a simple inconvenience, the ***customer is at the forefront*** of every product's mission.

Learn and be curious (Amazon's fifth leadership principle) is perhaps the most important guiding rule in my life. I always go the extra mile to ensure that everything that I touch is modernized and optimized to the greatest extent that it can be. Whether its collecting AWS Certs and understanding the 250+ services that they offer to optimize pipelines in our cloud-based world or delving deep into PMI study material to learn how to manage project teams better or simply spending my weekend improving my coding/scripting skills, ***I always am making an effort to learn more and create better products***.

Coming from a background in English Literature, I had only recently changed paths and discovered my passion for creating and improving technology that improves the lives of others. I especially grew a fondness for cloud-based products. Designing, creating and deploying software all without local resources is truly a marvel and the future of technology as we know it. Nothing makes me happier than seeing our stakeholder's visions for a product come to fruition.

***Think Big. Be Frugal. Deliver Results and Always Learn and Be Curious!!!***
